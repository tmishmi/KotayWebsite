<H3>An Introduction to Kotay</H3>

<p> Kotay is a game of building and conquest. This game will take you on a fascinating journey on how kingdoms were built and how superpowers emerged throughout history. As you strategize and devise ways for your kingdom to survive in the midst of friends and foes, building up your strengths and assessing the weaknesses of others, both your wits and courage will be tested. While fate can seal the deeds, it is your hands that will wield the swords and your men who control the cannons. It will be as it has been said by the great Sun Tzu in the Art of War:</p>

<p style="font-size: 150%;"> <em> “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.” </em> <br>

<em>we want you to experience the awesomeness of Kotay</em>
